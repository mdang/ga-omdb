# ga-omdb

Using the API from http://www.omdbapi.com/, construct a single page app that will have a search input box, movie search results, and movie detail portions.

## Requirements
* Use either Angular or Jquery to solve this problem. If you would like, you can use some other front end javascript library (Backbone, Ember, React)
* Submit us a github link to the project with proper commit messages.

##Bonus
* Though a backend is not required for this challenge, incorporating Rails for additional features of this app would impress us.
* Use a templating language of your choice for displaying results
* Use routing on your app, via # or pushstate features of javascript. Make it spiffy! Use Bootstrap or Foundation, or design your own html.
